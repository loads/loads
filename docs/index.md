# Loads v2

## Welcome to the Mozilla Loads Project

Mozilla Loads is a server-side tool designed to use AWS to help you load test
your HTTP services, including web sockets. Built using Python, it's goal is
to give you a flexible automated solution that integrates with several popular
Python testing tools.

## The Loads Tools

* [Loads Broker](https://github.com/loads/loads-broker)
* [Loads web dashboard](https://github.com/loads/loads-web)

## Development Process

### Issue Management

Most of our work takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com). We use labels
and milestones in the issues sections for the individual projects
and then [waffle.io](https://waffle.io) for an overview of
issues and work-in-progress for the project.
